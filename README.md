Important Notice to All Users and Contributors:

I am a first-year AI student with limited experience in machine learning algorithms. This project, HeartRiskPredictor, is a personal endeavor born from a deeply personal experience and a desire to make a positive impact in the world of healthcare. My motivation is to create a system that can potentially save lives by predicting the risk of heart attacks based on various health indicators.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the accuracy of HeartRiskPredictor in its current state may not meet professional healthcare standards. As a novice in this complex field, I understand that my initial model may have limitations and a margin of error that could be significant.

Given these constraints, I have decided to make HeartRiskPredictor an open-source project. My hope is that by opening this project to the wider community, more experienced developers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals can contribute their expertise. Together, we can refine the algorithm, enhance its accuracy, and bring it closer to being a reliable tool for heart attack risk assessment.

I encourage contributions, suggestions, and constructive criticism from all quarters. This is not just a project, but a journey towards creating something meaningful and life-changing. Your expertise, insights, and code contributions can help in steering this project towards a future where it can truly make a difference.

Remember, this is a collaborative effort: Together, we can!


HeartRiskPredictor: Machine Learning for Heart Attack Prediction

Overview
HeartRiskPredictor is an innovative machine learning project developed in the wake of a personal tragedy. It is designed to assess the risk of heart attacks in individuals by analyzing their health data, with a focus on pre-existing diseases. This project aims to provide a proactive tool for early heart attack risk detection, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.

Why HeartRiskPredictor is Useful
Heart attacks are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, often occurring unexpectedly. However, certain pre-existing conditions can increase the risk of a heart attack. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to analyze these risk factors, providing a quantifiable risk assessment. This tool can be particularly useful for healthcare professionals, individuals with a history of heart-related diseases, and researchers in the medical field.

Data Preparation:
Prepare your dataset according to the guidelines provided in the data_format.md file.

Training the Model:
Use the training scripts to train the model on your dataset.

Using the Predictor:
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict heart attack risks based on input data.
